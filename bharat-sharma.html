	    <br/>
	    <small>(Speaker : tedxDharamsala,2013)</small></h4>
	  <h4>SPEAKER BIO</h4>
	  <p>
	    Bharat Sharma's career in dance spanning over four decades is marked by a diversity of experiences in performing arts and related fields as performer, choreographer, teacher, writer, technician and administrator.   
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Born in a family of modern dancers, Bharat grew up in an environment that was conducive for artistic growth. Groomed in principles of choreography by his father, Narendra Sharma (1972-1990) at Bhoomika Creative Dance Centre in New Delhi, he also received thorough grounding in Mayurbhanj Chhau under Krishna Chandra Naik (1977-1979) and learnt Kathakali (1978-1979) from Sadanam Balakrishnan.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    In USA, a full-scholarship from Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival (1979) and fellowship from Asian Cultural Council (1982) helped him to train in modern dance, ballet and Jazz techniques. In New York he studied at Nikolais/Louis Dance Lab, Merce Cunningham Studio and Ruth Currier Studio and in North Carolina at American Dance Festival. In 2001 & 2003 he studied Composition in France under Susan Buirge.

	    As a dancer, Bharat's career has been prolific. As a performer with Bhoomika he danced as a soloist for eighteen years in India and abroad, and gave over 500 performances. He danced Mayurbhanj Chhau in Krishna Chandra Naik's productions 'Khajuraho' (1979) and  'Kaling Vijay' (1980) in Delhi, and with Claudia Gitelman and Dancers (1982) in New York. As an independent soloist, he has participated in major festivals including Navnritya Festival, Calcutta (1986); East-West Encounters, Mumbai and Delhi (1984 & 1993); Nritya Pratibha, Delhi (1986); Nitya Nritya, Bangalore (1986); American Dance Festival, USA (1984); La Danse A Aix, France (1984); and Festival of Indian Performing Arts, Germany (1994).

	    As an administrator, between 1994-1999, he was part of the first team to build India Foundation for the Arts, Bangalore - an independent national grant-making institution. As a Programme Director, he initiated and steered the arts collaboration programme and monitored arts research and documentation grants that covered a wide range of areas in traditional and modern arts including theatre, dance, cinema, sculpture, painting, material culture and museum development.

	  <h4>Taking Dance to its Audience...</h4>
	  <div class="ca-content-text">
	    <p>
	      
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      Entry of dance in media, thereby media technology into inner recesses of our private spaces, has stunted peoples habit of stepping out of their homes to see performances as a community. Conversely, there has been an unprecedented dance boom, in myriad forms and expressions - humans have never danced before the way they do today. Artists have to make sense of this phenomenal change and re-position dance in relation to its audience to evolve a mutually engaged constituency.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      India lacks professional support systems that mediate between dance and its other, the audience. Dance has always thrived through patronage. Where are the patrons? Unfortunately in India, the entire burden has been left on practitioners to fend for themselves from the beginnings of creative process till the end point, of performing in front of elusive viewers. Little effort has been made for audience building for dance. For artists, dance will have to go to its audience to survive as performing art. But where are the audiences and how do we get to them? Who does this job?
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      Support systems need to be sensitive and acknowledge urban and rural, aesthetic and natural, cultural and social, and other divides. An eminent dance company Bhoomika, based in Delhi, is making an attempt in Kangra Valley to re-orient its creative process with select community based organizations and educational institutions. Given the flexibility embedded in practices of the dance company, an effort is being made to re-define its artistic outlook in relation to contexts of the district that has been culturally rich from antiquity, to address issues of aesthetics, education and community work that translates experiences in re-defining the art of dance itself.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      As an experiment, the dance company plans to reverse its own identity and creative process. In seeking its audience in Kangra Valley, Bhoomika is exploring the cultural space of an environment nestled in the mighty Himalayas, of a child wanting to be adopted, to help a group of eminence to transform its artistic practices of its inherent metropolitan bias?  Can a home be provided to a seeker?
