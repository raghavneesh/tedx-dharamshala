					<h4>Taking Dance to its Audience...</h4>
					<div class="ca-content-text">
						<p>
							Relationship between dance and its audience is cardinal for the survival of performance as an art form. From time immemorial this magical interface, based on human contact between the performer/s and viewer/s in a pre-determined time and space, has been celebrated. Given the changing context of performance in 21st century, expectations and tastes of audiences have dramatically changed, challenging dancers to re-think dynamics of their art.
						</p>
						<p>
							Entry of dance in media, thereby media technology into inner recesses of our private spaces, has stunted peoples habit of stepping out of their homes to see performances as a community. Conversely, there has been an unprecedented dance boom, in myriad forms and expressions - humans have never danced before the way they do today. Artists have to make sense of this phenomenal change and re-position dance in relation to its audience to evolve a mutually engaged constituency.
						</p>
						<p>
							India lacks professional support systems that mediate between dance and its other, the audience. Dance has always thrived through patronage. Where are the patrons? Unfortunately in India, the entire burden has been left on practitioners to fend for themselves from the beginnings of creative process till the end point, of performing in front of elusive viewers. Little effort has been made for audience building for dance. For artists, dance will have to go to its audience to survive as performing art. But where are the audiences and how do we get to them? Who does this job?
						</p>
						<p>
							Support systems need to be sensitive and acknowledge urban and rural, aesthetic and natural, cultural and social, and other divides. An eminent dance company Bhoomika, based in Delhi, is making an attempt in Kangra Valley to re-orient its creative process with select community based organizations and educational institutions. Given the flexibility embedded in practices of the dance company, an effort is being made to re-define its artistic outlook in relation to contexts of the district that has been culturally rich from antiquity, to address issues of aesthetics, education and community work that translates experiences in re-defining the art of dance itself.
						</p>
						<p>
							As an experiment, the dance company plans to reverse its own identity and creative process. In seeking its audience in Kangra Valley, Bhoomika is exploring the cultural space of an environment nestled in the mighty Himalayas, of a child wanting to be adopted, to help a group of eminence to transform its artistic practices of its inherent metropolitan bias?  Can a home be provided to a seeker?
